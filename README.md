# A python solution to syncrhonize folders between a remarkable and a computer

remarkable_sync is a (WIP) python programm that allows you to sync your remarkable with a folder in your system.

# Why?

The official remarkable syncing application performs poorly on Linux. Moreover, it does not give you a lot of freedom in its usage. As example, let's say that you open a book you are reading on the remarkable, to do so you need to: open the remarkable application, export it and then you finally can open it. With this solution, all these steps are automated directly into the computer filesystem.
